# SQL Chatbot Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-powered SQL Agent that can interpret natural language queries and generate results from a PostgreSQL database.

## Files

- **system_prompt.txt** – Instruction set for the AI Agent.
- **screenshots/** – Folder to store workflow and UI screenshots.

## Usage
1. Use `schema.json` to inform the chatbot about table structures.
2. Use `system_prompt.txt` as a system instruction in your AI model.
3. Store screenshots in the `screenshots/` directory for documentation.

## Deployment
- Can be integrated with n8n workflows, LangChain, or custom Python backends.
